# String-Calculator-Katalyst
Implementation of https://katalyst.codurance.com/string-calculator


I have covered all  desing wise and code aspects. From testing branch perspective, I think very few branches related to validation have not covered like providing alphabet as number as it became too long.

If I will get time, I will further improve it.

revert me in case of any query
